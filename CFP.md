We are looking for submissions on the wide topic of assembly:
* shellcoding
* demo scene
* reversing
* interesting use case

The talk should be technical but not black magic: the aim of this
conference is to actually show that assembly still matters these days.

Hands-on and real demo is appreciated.

Given this will be the first edition of this con, we expect mostly
italian people but we require your slide to be in english to achieve a
wider crowd after the event.  
We may ask you to give the talk in english if we will be able to reach
foreign people.

Expect a standard duration of 40minutes plus 5minutes for Q&A.

### How to submit

Submission will consist of:
* title of your talk
* brief abstract (~300words)
* name/nickname/twitter (will appear in speakers page)
* your bio (~100words)
* eventual previous presentation

Submit your proposal to [guly+assemblyday2020@guly.org](mailto:guly+assemblyday2020@guly.org) 

Deadline is TBD because we don't have a date for the con itself ;)
